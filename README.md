# DukunCuaca
Dukun Cuaca is a weather forecast application that I made as a form of training for myself as a mobile developer. I'm using kotlin and the API from https://api.weatherapi.com/

when develop this apps, i m using this :
-Retrofit (for request data from API)
-ViewModel (save the data and restore the data from API)
-LiveData (as observer for data)
